# wico
A *wi*reless *co*nnection manager.

Wico is an exercise in creating wifi manager for OpenBSD using the standard unix-like tools provided in the base system, such gems as awk, cat, grep, sed, uniq etc...

## Install
Move the wico shell script to either *~/bin* or */usr/local/bin*.
Move the wico.conf.sample to either */etc/wico.conf.sample.*, or *~/.wico.conf*

Ensure you have proper permissions to use *ifconfig*, *wpa_supplicant*, and possibly *dhclient*.
